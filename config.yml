# NOTE: For some updates the config will update automatically to add new
# variables. This will save you time as you wont have to reenter all your
# data but at a cost. Because of the way Bukkit has setup saving files all
# comments like this under 'configVersion' will be removed. A config with
# comments is available here - https://github.com/TyrellPlayz/ServerMail/wiki/Config.

# If you don't want it to automatically update just disable it below, but you will have
# to update it yourself from - https://github.com/TyrellPlayz/ServerMail/wiki/Config.
